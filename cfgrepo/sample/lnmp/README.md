Quickly set up LNMP as a sample.

Step by Step
============

0. Make sure all the dependences libs / packages are installed.
   Check the following dependeces section for details.
1. get the bootstrap.py
   wget http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
2. link leocornus cfgrepo
   ln -s /PATH/TO/leocornus.buildout.cfgrepo
3. start buildout.cfg
   vim buildout.cfg
4. the buildout.cfg could be as simple as just 2 lines:

   [buildout]
   # extends from the base buildout config.
   extends = buildout-base.cfg
   
   # tweak the setting for different environment, for example:
   # - development server
   # - local desktop
   # - stage server
   # - production server

5. execute the bootstrap.py:
   $ python bootstrap.py
6. execute buildout.
   $ bin/buildout
7. FINGER CROSS...
